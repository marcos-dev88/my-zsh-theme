# Magic Cube Theme

It's a custom oh-my-zsh dark theme, with some functionalities like: file location, git status and time, to improve development and your confy on shell;

Fell free to use this theme :)

This theme was inspired by one already created oh-my-zsh theme called 'fino-time';

### Requirements
```shell
* oh-my-zsh
```

### Instalation
1. Just make a git clone from this repo;
2. Copy this theme 'magic-cube-theme.zsh-theme' to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes` folder;
3. Inside your `.zshrc` file change the value from your variable called `ZSH_THEME` to the name of this theme like: `ZSH_THEME="magic-cube-theme.zsh-theme"`
4. Run the command: `source ~/.zshrc`
